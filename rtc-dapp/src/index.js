    /* ipfs-pubsub-room does not have a stable implementation of direct 
     * messaging to ipfs peers listening on a pubsub topic. Therefore 
     * we implement message routing ourselves - the RTCManager sends 
     * SDP offers and answers using room.broadcast, specifying the recipient id
     * in the "to" field of message.data; the code below parses and filters 
     * incoming messages, and only handles those addressed to the current client 
     * 
     * Keep in mind that this is not secure, given that we're exchanging detailed
     * information about each client's external AND internal IPs and firewall config.
     * An exercise for the reader is to leverage Arweave or another blockchain to 
     * encrypt the messages with the recipients's public key (which is their address on the blockchain)
     * That way, only the intended recipient can decrypt the message, because they have the 
     * private key in their wallet
     * 
     * Due to the lack of security and the high latency of IPFS pubsub, 
     * we are using this network ONLY for peer discovery and exchange of metadata
     * needed to setup direct p2p connections between the peers: when a client joins a 
     * channel, they are connected directly to each of the clients listening on the channel. 
     * This allows the formation of a webrtc P2P mesh network for each channel 
     * that is totally self contained and secure, allowing clients to exchange data 
     * without any external dependencies once connected */
